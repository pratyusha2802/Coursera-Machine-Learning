# Coursera-Machine-Learning
By Andrew Ng, Stanford University

This is a repo containing my programming assignment submissions to the Coursera course on Machine learning offered by the Stanford University. I started taking this course in September 2021 and completed the theory part by November 2021. Got done with the practical MATLAB assignments in Oct 2022.
